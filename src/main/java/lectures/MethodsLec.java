            // remind students of difference in DEFINING and CALLING a method

        // overload with a sayHello method with no parameters
            // introduce NO ARG term

        // overload with an int to print hello a number of times
            // show reuse by calling the no arg version

        // talk about passing by value and how to change a parameter's value OUTSIDE of the function
            // demo string changeMe function
            // 2 ways to change outside variable:
                // 1. pass it contained in an object (WILL SHOW NEXT WEEK)
                // 2. or make it global (show the static shuffle) and advise to be careful

        // fun with recursion!
            // briefly go over codeup's count example
            // BRIEFLY use my fun w recursion slides to talk in more depth
                // maybe show my fibonacci examples
